### **Key Takeaway for Credit Card Companies**

Credit card companies sit at the intersection of massive transaction volume, long-term data sensitivity, and global infrastructure—making them ideal candidates for quantum networking. Unlike banks that might need QKD for specific high-value transfers, credit card companies need quantum security for their entire ecosystem due to the interconnected nature of payment networks. The investment in quantum networking isn't just about security—it's about maintaining the trust that underpins the entire global payment system.

**Recommended Starting Point**: Begin with QRNG for key generation and PQC implementation while piloting QKD between your most critical data centers. This provides immediate security improvements while building expertise for full quantum network deployment.
