# Comprehensive MCP Security Stack Assessment: Barndoor + TrojAI + Zenity

## Executive Summary

Based on the research, achieving comprehensive MCP security requires a layered approach:
- **Barndoor.ai**: Control plane for MCP governance, access control, and policy enforcement
- **TrojAI**: Advanced threat detection for trojans, backdoors, and adversarial attacks in AI models

## Conclusion

**For comprehensive MCP security, all three platforms are recommended:**

2. **TrojAI** adds critical model security and adversarial protection
3. **Zenity** delivers agent-centric visibility and behavioral analysis

This layered approach ensures defense-in-depth against the full spectrum of MCP threats, from infrastructure attacks to model manipulation to agent misbehavior.

**Budget Considerations:**
- **Minimum viable**: Barndoor + Zenity (infrastructure + visibility)
- **Recommended**: All three platforms
- **Phased approach**: Start with Barndoor, add others based on threat landscape

**Next Steps:**
1. Schedule POCs with all three vendors
2. Conduct integrated testing of the stack
3. Develop combined security policies
4. Train SOC on unified operations
